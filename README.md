# EasyjobRequester

EasyJob is a Rental management software I use in my company (Pro Audio for concerts, <a href="www.dushow.com">Dushow</a>)

Easyjob manages a database consisting in Equipments, Clients, People & trucks, Adresses, Projects, Quotes, etc... And has a SAAS version which has very little documentation.

EasyjobRequester is a little utility I used to test EasyJob's Web API.


<h2>Features</h2>

 - Making a login POST Request a retrieving a JSON Web Token, used in further GET / POST requests
 - Making GET requests and displaying JSON response
 - Making POST requests and displaying JSON response
 - "Complex" multiple-requests to get a list of people working on a precise project, and their coordinates

<h3>Basicly just a small "talking to an API" exercice.</h3>

Doesn't work from GitHub Pages for http/https reasons & due to the need of domain authorization from my company's sysadmin.
